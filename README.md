# http_mock_server

This repo contains basic code to setup a http server in python.
The code contains steps to create request handlers for get and post with different endpoints and how to handle the different error codes.

Also to validate the logic and coverage of source code a unittest file is setup which can be used to validate the current get calls and can be expanded to test any new calls and functions which gets added to the http server.
